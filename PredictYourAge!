/* TASK:
Description:
My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
Multiply each number by itself.
Add them all together.
Take the square root of the result.
Divide by two.
Example
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.
SOLUTION: */






function predictAge(...a){
  return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(a.reduce((x,y)=>x+y*y,0))/2)
}


















/*
TEST:
describe("Fixed tests", function() {
  Test.assertEquals(predictAge(65,60,75,55,60,63,64,45), 86);
  Test.assertEquals(predictAge(32,54,76,65,34,63,64,45), 79);
});

describe("Random tests", function() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    let arr = Array.from("12345678", _ => 40 + Math.random() * 51 | 0);
    Test.assertEquals(predictAge(...arr), Math.hypot(...arr)>>1);
  }
});
